# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Watershed-Algorithm

This method incorporates with, segmentation and morphological operations which are the basic concepts of image processing. Detection and extraction of tumour from MRI scan images of the brain is done by using MATLAB software. We first want concentrate creating a program which requires a small processing time for result .

Executing the code

Open the Code in matlab
Change the directory for each input image
Example for image 5 I=imread('C:\Users\Manjunatha\Desktop\5.jpg');
